Annual Target Distribution Calculator (Excluding Fridays)
This Node.js script allows users to calculate the total number of working days between two dates, excluding Fridays, and proportionally distribute a given annual target across those days. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface for entering dates and targets, helping users allocate their annual targets based on actual working days.

Key Features
Excludes Fridays: The script automatically skips Fridays and only considers working days from Monday to Thursday, as well as Saturday and Sunday, making it ideal for users who need to exclude Fridays from their workweek.

Proportional Target Distribution: Based on the number of working days (excluding Fridays), the script calculates and distributes the user-specified annual target proportionally. This ensures a fair and accurate allocation of the target across the entire period.

Interactive and Simple: The script provides an intuitive, interactive command-line interface that prompts users for input, including start and end dates, as well as the total annual target, making it straightforward and easy to use
